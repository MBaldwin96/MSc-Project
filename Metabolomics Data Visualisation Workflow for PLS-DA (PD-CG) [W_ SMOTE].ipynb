(2021). The study compared the metabolomic profiles across Parkinson's disease patients, characterised as medicated (MD; n=138) and drug-naive (DN; n=80), versus control (CG; n=56) using 8765 named metabolites. For the purpose of this computational workflow, only the (DN & MD) vs CG samples were compared in a binary discriminant analysis. The deconvolved and annotated data from this study is deposited on Metabolomics Workbench (Study ID: MTBLS2266)\n","\n","This computational workflow requires a dataset to be in, or converted to, a previously described standardised Excel file format (Mendez et al. 2019). This format uses the Tidy Data Framework (Wickham, 2014), where each row represents an observation (e.g. sample) and each column represents a variable (e.g. age or metabolite). Each excel file (per study) contains two sheets; a data sheet and a peak sheet. The data sheet contains the metabolite concentration together with the metadata associated for each observation (requiring the inclusion of the columns: Idx, SampleID, and Class). The peak sheet contains the additional metadata that pertains to the metabolites in the data sheet (requiring the inclusion of the columns: Idx, Name, and Label). The standardisation of this format allows for the efficient re-use of this computational workflow.\n","\n","The steps included in this data analysis and visualisation workflow are:\n","1. Import Packages \n","2. Load Data and Peak Sheet\n","3. Data Pre-processing\n","4. Split Data into Train and Test Set\n","5. Hyperparameter Optimisation\n","6. Build Model and Evaluate\n","7.
